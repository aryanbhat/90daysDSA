Got to know big-oh is the worst case and
there is omega and theta
omega is best case.
theta is the average time taken or average case
and got to know about little oh,theta,omega.
Got to know Space complexity:- It is the input space we require + the auxilary space needed by the algorithm to run perfectly.
looked more examples of nested loops to know how to calculate the time complexity of the code written.
